This is bala 
I added these line to git hub today
how to commit these code to online 
Fuck this git very hard to understand 

Dependency inversion/Dependency Injection/Inversion of control
//A class has dependency on class b, class c
//it creates an object of class b, c inside of class A
//it says to class A tell me what is the dependecies for u to work
//spring framework will create all the dependencies required for Class A
//by using design patterns we can achieve dependency inversion
//Factory design pattern
//spring performs dependency injection for us
//DI types
//setter based dependency injection
//constructor based dependency injection
//Types of app context
//ClassPathXMLApplicationContext - bootstraps spring from project classpath xml files
//FileSystemXMLApplicationContext - loads the app context from File system
//XMLWebApplicationContext - its used for webapplications(MVC, Security,Webflow etc..)
--Spring Modules
Core Container(DI), 
Data Access/Integration(JDBC, Hibernate, JPA, transactions), 
Web - MVC, Webflow, Security(MVC), 
AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), 
Instrumentation, 
Messaging(JMS, Webservices..), 
and Test(Test spring beans(Junit))
//Bean Factory - lightweight spring container
//BeanFactory vs ApplicationContext
BeanFactory does a post instatiation of the beans(it instantiates the beans during request time)
AppContext instatiates the beans during spring container startup
- Appcontext provides us AOP,messaging, internolization etc..

--Spring bean scopes
 - singleton scope (only one single instance per given bean in a container)
 - prototype scope( creates a new instance for every request)
 --web purposes
  -Request - creates a new isntance per HttpRequest
  -Session - creates a new instance for every HttpSession
  -GlobalSession - portal and portlet application
 
 
--defining spring beans with annotations
-- Pure XML based configuration
- XML plus annotations
 -@Component(any class as spring managed bean), @Service(service classes), @Repository(DAO classes)
 -@Controller and @RestController(MVC purposes)

--bean auto wiring - performing dependency injection without using constructor or setter based DI
--autowiring beans in xml - no(explicity specify the dependencies), name, type, constructor
--autowired annotation
--qualifier annotation usage - bean conflicts
--defining constants
--defining datastructures
--bean aliasing
--reading property files
--importing resources
--spring Lazy init
--inheriting beans using spring

Session - 28

--spring lookup method DI
--spring bean lifecycle
- Java based configuration or Complete Annotation approach(Java based configuration)
-Spring Data
--JDBC,JPA 

Session - 29

- Spring bean profiles - System.setProperty("spring.profiles.active", "dev");appContext.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("dev");
- Spring MVC 
- JSP's for views
- Jquery and Javascript for any thing we want to do on the client side
- Hibernate for ORM,
- Will add Spring Transaction management

 - ACID properties
 Atomic - All or nothing
 Consistent - db constraints never violated
 Isolation - how transactions see work done by others
 Durable - committed changes are permanent
 -Transaction management types
-- declarative transaction management - container managed transactions (spring makes use of AOP(around(before+after) advice) to create the transactional context for your target method)
  --@Transactional annotation(on class level(all method in ur class will run inside a transaction) /method level(only that method will run in a transactional context))
  --define transaction manager(different types of transaction manager)
  -- @EnableTransactionManagement, define transaction manager bean
  -- tx-annoation-driven element and transaction manager inside xml
  
-- programmatic transaction management - user managed transactions
 -- Transactional Template
 -- PlatformTransactionManager

 -isolation levels
  - Default - we are going with the isolation level defined by DBA
  - Read uncommitted - we always read uncommitted data..
  - Read Committed - This is the commonly used one
  - Repeatable reads - we perform multiple reads on a given transaction and is guaranteed to return the same data..(row level lock)
  - Serializable - sequential access, least preference, table level lock
 
 - dirty reads - (read uncommitted data which the transaction might commit or roll back)
 - phantom reads - (reads which will happen when we execute a query and there is a resultset that is being returned, and there is a new row added based on the criteria used in the query)
 - repetable/non-repetable reads = when u perform a non repeatable reads we get different data based on transaction commit or roll back status
 
 -propogation levels
 - Required -> txalreadyexists -> continue with the transaction, txdoesntexist - create a new transaction
 - RequiresNew -> txalreadyexists -> existing transaction is suspended and a new transaction is created, once the method is finished, ur outer transaction is resumed ,txdoesntexist-> creates a new one
 - Never ->txalreadyexists -> throws TransactionNotSupportedException, txdoesntexist-> well and good no issues
 - Supported(read only operations) ->txalreadyexists -> it will just run, txdoesntexist-> no issues,it will just run
 - Not Supported -txalreadyexists -> suspends the current transaction and the method will run, txdoesntexist->  it will just run
 - NESTED
 
- Will add spring AOP (Aspect oriented programming)
--address cross cutting concerns(log, transactions, exceptions..)
-aspectj framework allows us to define join points at various locations in a given class(constructors, methods, classes etc..)
 - Joinpoint - Method level join points (where actually we can apply an aspect(method level, class level, constructor level))
 - Pointcut - set of one or more join points where an advice can be applied
 - Aspect - defines the advice that needs to be applied
 - Advice - (before, after, around(before plus after), after throwing and after returning)
 - Weaving -(Compile time weaving and Run time weaving(spring used run time weaving))

---Spring security
-LDAP(people, roles), Active directory, DB,SSL
-Authentication(user-password(who can access ?)) vs Authorization(what he/she can access(resource level permissions))
-Integrating spring security in our application
-Performing single user authentication
-Performing Multi user DB authentication(where user and roles come from DB)
-Customizing authentication with our own login page and login controller
-Using Spring security tags to control access to resources based on roles
-Method level spring security
-Using encryption for passwords stored in db and configuring spring to use it(MD5 and bcrypt)
-Using Spring with LDAP authentication
-Making our app use https(SSL authentication(certificates(self signed certificate , certificate providers)))

----Self signed certificate steps
